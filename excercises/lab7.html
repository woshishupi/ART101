##This script uses the jQuery selector nice-block span. It selects the <span> buttons inside .nice-block. When a button
    is clicked, this refers to the clicked button; it then finds the outer <div> and uses toggleClass("more") to toggle
        expand or collapse. The CSS makes nice-block show only a small portion of the text by default, and adding more
        will expand it. So the script checks the button text: if it is more it changes to less, otherwise it changes
        back to more. The overall logic is that clicking a button expands only that block and toggles the button text.
